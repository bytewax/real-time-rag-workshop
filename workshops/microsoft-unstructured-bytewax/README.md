# Building Real-Time RAG for Financial Data and News

We’re excited to invite you to our upcoming workshop in collaboration with Microsoft and Unstructured, hosted by AICamp.

📅 Date and Time: June 4, 10 am PT

⏱️ Duration: 2 hours

💻 Format: Virtual, FREE

Financial news and analytics with LLMs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating external information during the generation process. This approach combines the generative strengths of LLMs with the retrieval of relevant information from a large dataset, allowing for more informed, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs. By enabling real time analytics capabilities within RAG systems, we can ensure users obtain the latest information.

Designed for Data/ML/AI engineers, Data scientists, Software engineers interested in data processing, IT professionals looking to understand and apply RAG

In this workshop, we will focus on designing RAG pipelines through data flow pipeline design including Directed Graphs (DG), and the integration of real-time analytics.

**Takeaway**

❗️ Attendees will learn ➡️ how to set up efficient RAG pipelines that cater to the complexities of varied data types, driving enhanced decision-making and insights in their organizations.

This workshop will use financial data as its use case, and will leverage a combination of structured and unstructured data such as stock and market prices as well as publicly available news.

One of the challenges of financial data is how quickly it becomes irrelevant - both in terms of the market prices and any events around it.

**Goals**

Gain proficiency in setting up and managing RAG pipelines for diverse data types;
Leverage Bytewax for integrating real-time analytics into your data processing workflows;
Incorporate Unstructured to process image and web based information;
Incorporate Azure AI services to deploy and manage RAG pipelines;
Understand the nuances of working with both structured and unstructured data in a unified system;
Develop the skills to architect, deploy, and optimize advanced RAG systems in real-world scenarios. 💼📈📰
