High costs, sparse charging infrastructure and politicized adoption have slowed EV momentum, while <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/39004756/teslas-top-chinese-rival-byd-unveils-5th-gen-dm-hybrid-technology-pioneering-1-250-miles-range-r\">hybrids gain traction</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peterson&#8217;s research note highlights how hybrid adoption impacts metals and critical minerals, revising forecasts for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and hybrids globally and in the U.S. for 2024-2035. The implications include BEV deceleration and hybrid acceleration, with a modest impact on rare earths forecasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sluggish Near-Term US EV Adoption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Global EV/PHEV sales growth in 2024 has been led by China&#8217;s market, with flat or declining performance in the U.S. and EU-5 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2024, China, EU-5 and U.S. combined EV/PHEV sales reached approximately 1.06 million units, with a sales penetration of 28.6%. China recorded meaningful gains (+6.7% Y/Y), while the U.S. saw a slight rebound (+1.5% Y/Y) and the EU-5 experienced a slight decrease (-0.4% Y/Y).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. EV/PHEV sales penetration rose to 9.6% in April 2024, with EV-specific penetration increasing to 7.5%. However, EV incentives declined 26.0% M/M in April, driven by <strong>Tesla Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) significant price cuts, according to Peterson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these cuts, EV inventory remained elevated, with a 90-day supply, highlighting the struggle to boost sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8216;The Chicken And The Egg&#8217; Issue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;chicken and the egg&#8221; issue persists with charging infrastructure, as operators are hesitant to install chargers in low-utilization areas, while EV adoption hinges on reliable charging, the analyst notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, 90% of global fast charger growth occurred in China, with the U.S. lagging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-density areas and multifamily dwellings face additional challenges, increasing lifetime charging costs by $10,000-$26,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hybrid Vehicles: A Cost-Effective Alternative</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid vehicles have reached cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles eliminating the need for high-power charging infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2024, 118,435 hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) were sold in the U.S., up 17.8% Y/Y, with <strong>Toyota Motor Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TM#NYSE\">TM</a>) leading the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average price of a hybrid is around $44,000, similar to ICE vehicles and up to $10,000 lower than EVs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">US Automakers Shift Focus To Hybrids Over EVs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. automakers are increasingly focusing on hybrids over EVs. Toyota&#8217;s hybrid sales accounted for 45% of its total volumes, while <strong>Ford Motor Co (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE\">F</a>) aims to double its hybrid F-150 sales to 20%. <strong>Kia Corp</strong> (OTCPK:KIMTF) and <strong>Stellantis NV </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/STLA#NYSE\">STLA</a>) also prioritize hybrids and PHEVs as transitional solutions before expanding their EV offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39027905/stellantis-plans-to-build-two-more-hybrid-vehicles-in-italy-amid-political-tensions-report\">Stellantis Plans To Build Two More Hybrid Vehicles In Italy Amid Political Tensions: Report</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hybrids Offer A Viable Bridge Solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid penetration is expected to remain significant in the U.S. through the midterm, with forecasts predicting a stable mix of hybrid, PHEV and BEV sales. The global market, previously not expected to exceed 20% hybrid penetration, is now anticipated to reach this level in the next 2-3 years, driven by markets outside China, Peterson notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While EV adoption faces challenges, hybrids offer a viable bridge solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As cost and charging infrastructure barriers are addressed, EVs may eventually gain broader acceptance, but hybrids are set to play a crucial role in the transition to a greener automotive future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/39004756/teslas-top-chinese-rival-byd-unveils-5th-gen-dm-hybrid-technology-pioneering-1-250-miles-range-r\">Tesla&#8217;s Top Chinese Rival BYD Unveils 5th Gen DM Hybrid Technology, Pioneering 1,250 Miles Range: Report</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>", "symbols": ["F", "KIMTF", "STLA", "TM", "TSLA"], "source": "benzinga"}
