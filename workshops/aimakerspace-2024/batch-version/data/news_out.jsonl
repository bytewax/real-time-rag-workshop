The study&#8217;s metric, which filters out transactions initiated by bots and large-scale traders, showed that of the $2.2 trillion total transactions in April, only $149 billion were \"organic payments activity\", as <a href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/more-90-stablecoin-transactions-arent-real-users-study-finds\">reported</a> by The Business Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings are contradictory to the claims of stablecoin advocates, including fintech heavyweights like <strong>PayPal</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PYPL#NASDAQ\">PYPL</a>) and <strong>Stripe</strong>, who are making substantial progress in the stablecoin arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pranav Sood</strong>, executive general manager for the EMEA region at payments platform <strong>Airwallex</strong>, stated that stablecoins are at a very early stage as a payment instrument.  \"That's not to say that they don't have long-term potential, because I think they do. But the short-term and the mid-term focus needs to be on making sure that existing rails work much better,\" Sood said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/ \"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29155259/905735A6-57D3-4874-9AA1-75D037842DB3-2.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-270548\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38318256/tether-looks-beyond-stablecoins-restructures-operations-into-four-divisions\">Tether Looks Beyond Stablecoins, Restructures Operations Into Four Divisions</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Data provider<strong> Glassnode </strong>estimated that the record $3 trillion of total market circulation attributed to digital tokens at the peak of the 2021 bull market was actually around $875 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visa, which processed over $12 trillion worth of transactions last year, could potentially lose out if stablecoins become a universally accepted payment method. However, analysts at Bernstein predict that the total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach $2.8 trillion by 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes at a time when the U.S. is making strides towards stablecoin regulation.

Data from the open-label trial were presented previously at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 Annual Meeting, and subsequently updated at ASCO 2022 and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023.</p><p>The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ pancreatic cancer following progression with prior systemic therapy or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Additionally, the FDA has granted BTD to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ NSCLC, following progression with prior systemic therapy.</p><p>Zeno is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p><p><strong>About Zeno</strong></p><p>Zeno is a Biclonics&#xAE; that utilizes the Merus Dock &amp; Block&#xAE; mechanism to inhibit the neuregulin/HER3 tumor-signaling pathway in solid tumors with NRG1 fusions (NRG1+ cancer). Through its unique mechanism of binding to HER2 and potently blocking the interaction of HER3 with its ligand NRG1 or NRG1-fusion proteins, Zeno has the potential to be particularly effective against NRG1+ cancer. In preclinical studies, Zeno potently inhibits HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation thereby inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and blocking tumor cell survival. In clinical studies, Zeno has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple types of NRG1+ cancer, including NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC.</p><p><strong>About NRG1 Fusions</strong></p><p>The NRG1 gene encodes neuregulin (also known as heregulin), the ligand for HER3. Fusions between NRG1 and partner genes are rare, tumorigenic genomic events occurring in certain cancer types including NSCLC and PDAC.</p>", "symbols": ["MRUS"], "source": "benzinga"}

In an analysis of 52,565 patients from the state-wide Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) and the nation-wide Decipher GRID database, researchers found wide variation of Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier scores within STAR-CAP risk groups. Overall, they found Decipher testing augmented by at least one STAR-CAP stage both upstaging for about 25% and down-staging for nearly 50% of cases, suggesting that integration of genomic with advanced clinicopathologic staging systems may lead to further improvements to risk stratification across the clinical spectrum of localized disease.</li></ul><p>The following study demonstrates the Decipher Bladder test's utility in informing treatment decisions for patients with bladder cancer:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auajournals.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1097%2F01.JU.0001009500.87761.bf.07&amp;esheet=53973323&amp;newsitemid=20240506512666&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Poster+MP15-07&amp;index=7&amp;md5=f1006e945ef7a5b848515702ba80cab4\"><strong>Poster MP15-07</strong></a><strong>: Molecular subtyping for predicting non-organ confined disease and survival outcomes after radical cystectomy in clinical high-grade T1 and T2 bladder cancer patients.

The Company repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $13.40 per share, for an aggregate amount of $100 million, under the Stock Repurchase Program.

The Special Dividend is intended to reflect the cash flow generated by the Company through the merger date. The amount of the Special Dividend, if any, shall be calculated in accordance with the Separation Agreement, and shall be based on the Company's cash and cash equivalents at closing in excess of a target of $30 million, further adjusted by: (i) the Company's net working capital relative to a net working capital target; (ii) the Company's indebtedness relative to the indebtedness as of December 31, 2023; (iii) any commitment fees and other fees paid by the Company prior to closing in connection with the financing contemplated by the transactions; and (iv) certain of the Company's transaction expenses and employee retention costs, to the extent unpaid, in each case as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, as well as the number of shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Special Dividend, and shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in the Separation Agreement.</p><p>In addition, on May 1, 2024, the Company implemented a mandatory sell-to-cover policy with respect to tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units (\"PSUs\"), in lieu of the Company's historical practice of withholding shares, with a view to retaining cash for the purposes of the Special Dividend.

The firm operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, mostly in the U.S., and treats over 240,000 patients globally each year. Government payers dominate U.S. dialysis reimbursement. DaVita receives about two thirds of U.S. sales at government (primarily Medicare) reimbursement rates, with the remainder coming from commercial insurers. However, while commercial insurers represented only about 10% of the U.S. patients treated, they represent nearly all of the profits generated by DaVita in the U.S. dialysis business.</p>\n<h3>DaVita: Delving into Financials</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> Surpassing industry standards, the company's market capitalization asserts its dominance in terms of size, suggesting a robust market position.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Revenue Trend:</strong> Examining DaVita's financials over 3 months reveals a positive narrative. The company achieved a noteworthy revenue growth rate of <strong>6.89%</strong> as of 31 March, 2024, showcasing a substantial increase in top-line earnings. When compared to others in the Health Care sector, the company faces challenges, achieving a growth rate lower than the average among peers.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Margin:</strong> DaVita's net margin is impressive, surpassing industry averages. With a net margin of <strong>7.8%,</strong> the company demonstrates strong profitability and effective cost management.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> DaVita's ROE stands out, surpassing industry averages. With an impressive ROE of <strong>24.18%</strong>, the company demonstrates effective use of equity capital and strong financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> DaVita's ROA stands out, surpassing industry averages. With an impressive ROA of <strong>1.4%</strong>, the company demonstrates effective utilization of assets and strong financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt Management:</strong> DaVita's debt-to-equity ratio stands notably higher than the industry average, reaching <strong>12.79</strong>. This indicates a heavier reliance on borrowed funds, raising concerns about financial leverage.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Relevance of Analyst Ratings</h2>\n<p>Within the domain of banking and financial systems, analysts specialize in reporting for specific stocks or defined sectors. Their work involves attending company conference calls and meetings, researching company financial statements, and communicating with insiders to publish \"analyst ratings\" for stocks. Analysts typically assess and rate each stock once per quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition to their assessments, some analysts extend their insights by offering predictions for key metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates. This supplementary information provides further guidance for traders. It is crucial to recognize that, despite their specialization, analysts are human and can only provide forecasts based on their beliefs.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "symbols": ["DVA"], "source": "benzinga"}

This signifies efficient cost management and strong financial health.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Coinbase Glb's financial strength is reflected in its exceptional ROE, which exceeds industry averages. With a remarkable ROE of <strong>16.39%,</strong> the company showcases efficient use of equity capital and strong financial health.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> The company's ROA is below industry benchmarks, signaling potential difficulties in efficiently utilizing assets.

With a ratio of <b>0.52</b>, the company relies less on debt financing, maintaining a healthier balance between debt and equity, which can be viewed positively by investors.</p>\n<h2>Analyst Ratings: Simplified</h2>\n<p>Analysts work in banking and financial systems and typically specialize in reporting for stocks or defined sectors.

Rivian has beaten estimates from analysts for revenue in seven of the last 10 quarters. A miss in the fourth quarter was the first miss on the analysts' estimate for revenue by Rivian in eight quarters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect Rivian to report a loss of $1.17 per share in the first quarter, compared to a loss of $1.25 in last year's first quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Analysts Are Saying:</strong> A question on demand for electric vehicles saw Needham analyst Chris Pierce lower the price target from $18 to $13 on Rivian in April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst, who has a Buy rating on Rivian, said demand for the R1S is better than feared, but long-term demand remains a key question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"R1S used vehicle pricing came in better than feared in our used EV OEM price tracker, and although price decreases are expected as used supply grows, we haven't seen any data that points to a steep drop-off in demand,\" Pierce said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst updates delivery estimates after the unveiling of the R2 vehicle with estimates for 2026 (154,378) and 2027 (237,037) ahead of consensus estimates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pierce also notes that the TAM (total addressable market) for Rivian will expand with the R2 and R3. The R2, however, is \"not a near-term catalyst.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We see RIVN as the best positioned EV OEM in our coverage, with the bridge to the TAM expanding R2 vehicle sturdier as the company reduces its planned capex by pushing out the timing of the build-out of its Georgia plant.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst also said Rivian starting with a clean slate in the electric vehicle market, versus legacy automakers transitioning, could benefit the company when it comes to supply chain and manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are other recent analyst ratings on Rivian and their price targets.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Truist: Hold rating, lowered price target from $11 to $10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Barclays: Equal-Weight rating, lowered price target from $12 to $10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UBS: Upgrades from Sell to Neutral, $9 price target</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Morgan Stanley: Overweight rating, lowered price target from $14 to $13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cantor Fitzgerald: Overweight rating, $23 price target</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Items to Watch: </strong>One of the key items to watch will be production and delivery updates. The company previously announced that first-quarter production was 13,980 vehicles and deliveries were 13,588 vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guidance from the company for the full year calls for production of 57,000 vehicles. An update on that figure could be anticipated from investors and analysts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rivian unveiled the R2 and R3 vehicles in a company event in March. The event was well received and investors and analysts could be looking for an update on how reservations for the R2 are tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company said in the last reported quarter that it was focused on cost efficiency and gross profit per delivered vehicle. Those metrics could be closely monitored in the first quarter results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RIVN Price Action: </strong>Rivian shares trade at $10.33 versus a 52-week trading range of $8.26 to 82.06.
