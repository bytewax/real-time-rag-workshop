# About the Workshop

Join in to gain the tools necessary to build efficient, real-time RAG pipelines. This event will cover the fundamentals of Retrieval Augmented Generation, data flow mechanics, and directed graphs (DGs), and will include code and material focused on implementing these concepts for real-time data processing and retrieval. Participants will gain a solid understanding of how RAG works as a powerful tool for AI applications, learn the intricacies of DG in processing architectures, and acquire practical skills in building real-time AI pipelines using Haystack and Bytewax. 

​Who Should Attend:

​* AI and machine learning practitioners interested in advanced model architectures.
* ​Data engineers and architects looking for real-time data processing solutions with LLMs.
* Researchers and students in computational fields exploring cutting-edge AI technologies.

​Event Agenda:

​* Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
​* Introduction to Data Flow and Directed Graphs (DGs) 
* RAG as a DG 
* ​Building Real-Time RAG with Bytewax and Haystack
