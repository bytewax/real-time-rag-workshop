       "In recent news, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc., has been involved in a series of events related to his compensation package and his relationship with President Joe Biden. Musk responded to claims made by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System CEO regarding his compensation package, expressing disagreement with the decision to vote against it. This development follows a $56 billion pay package that was overturned by a Delaware court, causing volatility in Tesla's stock and the need for a shareholder vote to reinstate it. Additionally, Musk criticized President Biden for prioritizing Tesla's unionization over its environmental impact, leading to tension between the two. Despite not endorsing Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Musk is considering an advisory role for Trump if he is re-elected. This relationship between Musk and Trump signals a potential pivot in their dynamics. On the financial front, Nvidia's stock surged following a funding announcement from Musk's xAI startup. The company saw a significant increase in its stock price, reflecting the positive impact of the funding news. Soft treasury auctions have influenced the stock market, along with a drop in Bitcoin related to Mt. Gox. Lastly, various consumer discretionary stocks experienced both gains and losses in the after-market session, showcasing market volatility.\n",
